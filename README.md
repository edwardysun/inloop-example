# Getting Started with the InLoop Connect Example

## Setup

Make sure to head to [the InLoop Connect dashboard](https://connect.inloop.to/dashboard) and set up your API Key. Then, after cloning this repo, make sure to put in your API key in `/server/index.js` on the line after `REPLACE WITH YOUR API SECRET KEY HERE`.

### Run the server: `npm start`

Run `npm start` on the project root to start the server on port 3001.

### Run the client: In another terminal window or tab, run `cd client && npm start`

Run `cd client && npm start` (in a new terminal window or tab) to start the React client on port 3000. It should pop up your browser and navigate to `localhost:3000`. If that doesn't happen, just open any browser and head to `http://localhost:3000` directly.

### Try it out!
